binson-go-tiny/README.md
=========================

A light-weight one-file Golang implementation of a Binson parser (decoder) and writer (encoder).

Binson is like JSON, but faster, binary and even simpler.
See [binson.org](https://binson.org/).

This library is a high-performance, low-level library suitable for embedded targets 
and the TinyGo compiler. The dependencies are limited, code size is small, and no dynamic
memory allocation is required to use the library.

STATUS: Work on progress.
